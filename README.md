## Installation üöÄ

```bash
# Using npm (Node.js package manager)

# Using yarn
yarn global add tokman-cli

# For local project usage
npm install --save-dev tokman-cli
# or
yarn add --dev tokman-cli
```
*(Adjust installation instructions based on the actual package manager and distribution method if different, e.g., direct download, other package managers.)*

## Quick Start üèÅ

1.  **Initialize Configuration:**
    ```bash
    tokman init
    ```
    This will create a `tokman.config.js` (or similar) file in your project root.

2.  **Define your style source(s)** in the configuration file.
    Example `tokman.config.js`:
    ```javascript
    // tokman.config.js (example)
    module.exports = {
      source: ['./styles/tokens.json'], // Path to your token definitions
      platforms: {
        css: {
          transformGroup: 'css',
          buildPath: 'dist/css/',
          files: [{
            destination: 'variables.css',
            format: 'css/variables'
          }]
        },
        // Add other platforms like scss, js, android, ios etc.
      }
    };
    ```
    *(This is a common structure for token tools like Style Dictionary; adjust if Tokman's config is different).*

3.  **Build your tokens:**
    ```bash
    tokman build
    ```
    Your generated tokens will be in the `dist/` directory (or as configured).

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Commands

*   `tokman init`: Initialize a new configuration file.
*   `tokman build`: Build/generate tokens based on the configuration.
*   `tokman clean`: Remove previously built artifacts.
*   `tokman --help`: Display help information for all commands.
*   `tokman <command> --help`: Display help for a specific command.

*(Add or modify commands as per actual CLI functionality)*

### Configuration

Tokman CLI is configured via a `tokman.config.js` (or `.json`, `.yaml`) file in your project root.

Key configuration options:
*   `source`: An array of glob patterns for your token source files.
*   `platforms`: An object defining output platforms (e.g., CSS, JS, SCSS, Android, iOS). Each platform specifies transformations, build path, and output files.

Refer to the [Full Configuration Documentation](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details. *(Consider creating a more detailed configuration doc if needed)*
